Title: The Wizard’s Spellbook Heap Adventure

Theme: Organize magical spells in a wizard's spellbook using heaps, prioritizing their power levels for various tasks!

Tasks:
1. Insert Spells into the Spellbook: Collect spell names and their corresponding power levels to create the foundation of the spellbook.

2. Create a Powerful Spellbook (Max-Heap):
Build a Max-Heap to prioritize the strongest spells at the top, perfect for battle-ready wizards.

3. Prepare a Beginner’s Spellbook (Min-Heap):
Convert the Max-Heap into a Min-Heap to reorder spells by their weakest powers, ideal for novice spellcasters.

4. Heapify the Spellbook:
Take a random, unordered list of spells and use heapification magic to reorganize it into a well-structured Max-Heap.

Learning Goals:
Through these tasks, wizards will gain insight into:
* How heaps work as binary tree structures.
* Efficient methods to prioritize data using Max and Min-Heaps.
* Transforming and restoring data using heap operations.
This magical heap adventure ensures Harry Potter (and you) can organize spells for any situation, whether facing Voldemort or training novice wizards!

Instructions:
Input:
The user will list spells with their names and power levels (e.g., Incendio: 30, Lumos: 10, Expecto Patronum: 50).

Output:
Heap at each transformation step (e.g., Max-Heap → Min-Heap → Heapified Spellbook).

A sorted view of the spells for clarity.
